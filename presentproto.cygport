CATEGORY="Devel"
SUMMARY="X.Org Present extension protocol headers"
DESCRIPTION="The Present extension provides a way for applications to update
their window contents from a pixmap in a well defined fashion, synchronizing
with the display refresh and potentially using a more efficient mechanism
than copying the contents of the source pixmap."
